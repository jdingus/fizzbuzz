This is a project part of the Thinkful online Python Curriculum.

Basis of the code is below:
  
  In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let’s say 100). For each number if it’s not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. If it’s divisible by 3, instead of the number you say “fizz”. If it’s divisible by 5, you say “buzz”. And finally if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, you say “fizz buzz”. So, counting from one to fifteen, you’d say: “One, two, fizz, four, buzz, fizz, seven, eight, fizz, buzz, eleven, fizz, thirteen, fourteen, fizz buzz”.

Program has the ability for user to pass arguments via command line or enter via prompt.

User enters how high to count in "fizzbuzz" and app runs.
Good first project especially in learning error handling.
